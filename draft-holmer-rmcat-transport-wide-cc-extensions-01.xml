    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an RTP header extension and an RTCP message
      for use in congestion control algorithms for RTP-based media flows. It
      adds transport-wide packet sequence numbers and corresponding feedback
      message so that congestion control can be performed on a transport level
      at the send-side, while keeping the receiver dumb.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document proposes RTP header extension containing a transport-wide
      packet sequence number and an RTCP feedback message feeding back the
      arrival times and sequence numbers of the packets received on a
      connection.</t>

      <t>Some of the benefits that these extensions bring are:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The congestion control algorithms are easier to maintain and
          improve as there is less synchronization between sender and receiver
          versions needed. It should be possible to implement
          <xref target="I-D.alvestrand-rmcat-congestion"></xref>,
          <xref target="I-D.zhu-rmcat-nada"></xref> and
          <xref target="I-D.johansson-rmcat-scream-cc"></xref> with the
          proposed protocol.</t>

          <t>More flexibility in what algorithms are used, as long as they are
          having most of their logic on the send-side. For instance different
          behavior can be used depending on if the rate produced is application
          limited or not.</t>

      <t></t>

      <section title="Semantics">
        <t>This RTP header extension is added on the transport layer, and uses
        the same counter for all packets which are sent over the same
        connection (for instance as defined by bundle).</t>
        <t>The benefit with a transport-wide sequence numbers is two-fold:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>It is a better fit for congestion control as the congestion
          controller doesn't operate on media streams, but on packet flows.</t>

          <t>It allows for earlier packet loss detection (and recovery) since a
          loss in stream A can be detected when a packet from stream B is
          received, thus we don't have to wait until the next packet of stream A
          is received.</t>

        <t>An RTP header extension with a 16 bits sequence number attached to
        all packets sent. This sequence number is incremented by 1 for each
        packet being sent over the same socket.</t>

      <section title="Signaling of use of this extension">
        <t>When signalled in SDP, the standard mechanism for RTP header
        extensions <xref target="RFC5285"></xref> is used:</t>

    <section title="Transport-wide RTCP Feedback Message">
      <t>To allow the most freedom possible to the sender, information about
      each packet delivered is needed. The simplest way of accomplishing that is
      to have the receiver send back a message containing an arrival timestamp
      and a packet identifier for each packet received. This way, the  receiver
      is dumb and simply records arrival timestamps (A) of packets. The sender
      keeps a map of in-flight packets, and upon feedback arrival it looks up
      the on-wire timestamp (S) of the corresponding packet. From these two
      timestamps the sender can compute metrics such as:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Link propagation time delta: d(i) = A(i) - S(i) - (A(i-1) - S(i-1))</t>
        <t>Estimated queueing delay: q(i) = A(i) - S(i) - min{j=i-1..i-w}(A(j) - S(j))</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Since the sender gets feedback about each packet sent, it will be set
      to better assess the cost of sending bursts of packets compared to aiming
      at sending at a constant rate decided by the receiver.</t>

      <t>Two down-sides with this approach are:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>It isn't possible to differentiate between lost feedback on the
        downlink and lost packets on the uplink.</t>
        <t>Increased feedback rate on the reverse direction.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Lost feedback messages shouldn't be a big problem as we could simply
      ignore losses which coincide with lost feedback messages from a congestion
      control perspective. This is similar to what would happen if an RTCP
      receiver report is lost.</t>

      <t>It is recommended that a feedback message is sent for every frame
      received, but in cases of low uplink bandwidth it is acceptable to send
      them less frequently, e.g., for instance once per RTT.</t>

      <section title="Message format">
        <t>The message is an RTCP message with payload type 206. RFC 3550
        <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> defines the range, RFC 4585
        <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> defines the specific PT value 206 and
        the FMT value 15.</t>

  <t>TODO: Add examples.</t>

  <t>The smaller receive delta upper bound of 63.75 ms means that this is only viable at about 1000/25.5 ~= 16 packets per second and above. With a packet size of 1200 bytes/packet that amounts to a bitrate of about 150 kbit/s.</t>

  <t>The 0.25 ms resolution means that up to 4000 packets per second can be represented. With a 1200 bytes/packet payload, that amounts to 38.4 Mbit/s payload bandwidth.</t>

    <section title="IANA considerations">
      <t>Upon publication of this document as an RFC (if it is decided to
      publish it), IANA is requested to register the string "goog-remb" in its
      registry of "rtcp-fb" values in the SDP attribute registry group.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>If the RTCP packet is not protected, it is possible to inject fake
      RTCP packets that can increase or decrease bandwidth. This is not
      different from security considerations for any other RTCP message.</t>
